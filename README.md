# FizzBuzzApp


### Description
First project with SKill Distillery. The famous game call "Fizzbuzz".
This program will count down from 1-100, and replacing each multiple of 3 with the word "fizz" and the multiple of 5 with the word "buzz". If there's both multiples of 3's and 5's it will print out the word "fizzbuzz".

### Technologies Used
To create this program I needed a for loop for the count down from 1-100.
Used a if statement to replace the numbers of multiples of 3, 5, and both with the designated word.

### Lesson Learned# FizzBuzzApp
First, I needed to understand how a for loop works, and identifying how many time does the for loop need to be repeatedly executed and know when to end the for loop. Since the game required to be print out numbers from 1 to 100, and replaces the multiples of 3's and 5's with the words "fizz" and "buzz" and if both of them are multiples of 3's and 5's replace it with "fizzbuzz"
This means I would need to have 3 if statement and an else statement taking in the  System.out.println(i); The order of the if statement was important on this program because this would determined if the multiples of 3's and 5's would be replaces with the words and not the numbers.
